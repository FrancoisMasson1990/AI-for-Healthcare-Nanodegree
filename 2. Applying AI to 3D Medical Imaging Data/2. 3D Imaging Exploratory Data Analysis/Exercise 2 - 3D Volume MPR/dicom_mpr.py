# TASK: In the same folder as this .py file you will find a DICOM folder
# with a volume in it. You can assume that all files belong to the same series.
# Your task is to visualize any three slices across the three 
# cardinal planes from this volume: Axial, Coronal and Sagittal. You can visualize 
# by saving them as png, similar to the previous exercise. You can visualize slice at 
# any level, but I suggest that you visualize slices located in the middle of the volume.

# 
# Bonus points: 
# 1) What is the modality that you are dealing with here?
# 2) Try to figure out which axis corresponds to what plane by searching online.
# You should have a good guess of what anatomy you are looking at if you visualize the middle slice
# 3) Try plotting the slices in non-primary planes with proper aspect ratio
#
# Hints:
# - You may want to rescale the output because your voxels are non-square. 
# - Don't forget that you need to order your slices properly. Filename 
# may not be the best indicator of the slice order. 
# If you're confused, try looking up the first value of ImagePositionPatient
# - Don't forget the windowing. A good initial guess would be scaling all
# image values down to [0..1] range when saving. Pillow deals with such well
